## Logistic Regression
1. Will Logistic Regression always converge? On what conditions will it never converge or always converge? (in case of perfect seperation, infinite possibilities)
1. What is the effect of co-linear features? (Not much if we want to focus only on the prediction, but the corresponding weights may fail to converge to final number).

( Let's say n and m are the number of features and training samples respectively. If n is large relative to m use log. Reg. or SVM with linear kernel, If n is small and m is intermediate, SVM with Gaussian kernel, If n is small and m is massive, Create or add more fetaures then use log. Reg. or SVM without a kernel)
